## Introduction

Predictive maintenance leverages historical data to predict equipment failures before they occur. This project utilizes sensor data from manufacturing equipment to build a predictive model that forecasts failures, helping businesses to plan maintenance activities efficiently.

## Dataset

The dataset includes sensor readings from manufacturing equipment, along with labels indicating equipment failures. The dataset can be found [here](#) (link to the dataset if available).

## Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values
- Normalized sensor readings
- Split the data into training and testing sets

## Feature Engineering

Extracted relevant features from the sensor data, such as:

- Sensor mean and standard deviation
- Rolling averages
- Differences and lags

## Model Training

- Used Random Forest classifier to train the predictive model
- Performed cross-validation to ensure robustness
- Explored other models like Gradient Boosting and XGBoost

## Model Evaluation

- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualized the ROC curve and calculated the AUC

## Visualization

- Plotted feature importance to understand the contribution of each sensor
- Visualized predictions against actual failures

## Results

The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy in predicting equipment failures. The feature importance analysis provided insights into which sensors are most indicative of potential failures.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predictive maintenance. By forecasting equipment failures, businesses can optimize maintenance schedules, reduce downtimes, and improve operational efficiency.
